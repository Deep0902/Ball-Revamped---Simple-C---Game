Successfully created a game, wherein you need to control a ball that must reach the target before a timer runs out, while dogging obstacles!

My role was to design and implement an algorithm for multiple scenarios in the program, 
like making necessary changes that the ball and the game in general is supposed to do when a specific action is performed, 
calculating the score based on time and lives remaining.

This project will run only using TurboC.
There are few modifications required to make the game run seamlessly.
There is some page flickering that can be easily noticed, due to which there is delay in the input.
